This is Jeremy and Mikes pair programming project

For the pair programming project, the portion that I worked on myself was the section of the page that features the three tabs.

Specifically, I put together the first of the three tabs, the "Contributions".

Jeremy put the JSON files in the proper directories on the Master branch and initiated the .js file on JeremyBranch
