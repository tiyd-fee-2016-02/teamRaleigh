Mike worked on the section of the page that features the three tabs.

Specifically, he configured the first of the three tabs, "Contributions".

Jeremy put the JSON files in the proper directories on the Master branch and initiated the .js file on JeremyBranch

Mike worked on putting the finishing touches on what remained for the CSS.

Jeremy did the jquery on the tabs

We worked together remotely (via Screenhero) to tackle the json business.

Mike added the nav elements next to the search bar providing the mouse over effects, and got all the buttons, margins and padding looking close to pixel perfect.
